# Capstone Project: Reliable Domain-Specific Chatbot for Thai Language

This Capstone project aims to address the challenges of generalized LLMs in handling domain-specific data and the Thai language, with a focus on mitigating hallucinations in responses. Our goal is to develop a chatbot that reliably generates high-quality, domain-specific responses, particularly for the legal field, and to demonstrate its end-to-end use case via the LINE application chat platform.
